The company was founded in 1935 and have been offering and developing products since. They have refined the vinyl making process to offer us, and you some of the best vinyl in the market! We have been working with Avery Dennison for years and delivered nothing but great results!\r\n\r\nWhat kind of decal do we use?\r\nFor our decals we use a mix of Avery Dennison 500 series which has a lasting outdoor life of 5 years and Avery Dennison 700 series with a length of 8 outdoor years.\r\n\r\nThese vinyls are weatherproof. They are built to last!\r\n\r\nOnce your decal has applied it is not able to be re positioned. The vinyl we use is created with quality and longevity in mind. It is made to stick to a surface for years to come.\r\n\r\nHow do I remove my decal?\r\nThe best way to remove a decal is to heat up the area the decal is sitting on with a hairdryer. This allows the adhesive on the back of the vinyl to have a glue like texture. Then you may peel the vinyl off or get a small blade and scrape the vinyl off. Once the decal has been removed you can wipe the area down ( we use wax and grease remover as it leaves a perfect clean area!).\r\n\r\nWill I need special tools for application? Do I need to hire someone?\r\nIn most cases you can apply standard sized decals with a credit card although if you want to be professional you can pick up a squeegee to apply you vinyl.\r\n\r\nCan I order custom made decals?\r\nYes! Yes! Yes! We offer custom solution for individuals & business. Just send us an email at kollektrstore@gmail.com and we can start working together to make sure we can fulfill your needs!\r\n\r\nDo you offer wholesale?\r\nWe certainly do.
