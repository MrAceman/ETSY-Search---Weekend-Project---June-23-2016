## ETSY Search - Importing and Displaying JSON Data Project

This HTML, CSS, and JS was created over the weekend of June 23rd through June 26th, 2016.  The goal was to take the items.js JSON data file provided copied from an ETSY search result and generate the HTML, CSS, and JS needed to duplicate the ETSY search page.

The primary purposes of this exercise were to work on importing and displaying JSON data and to continue working on HTML & CSS proficiency.  Additionally, jQuery was utilized to access the DOM and template literals were used in order to push updated HTML to the page.

This project has been deployed to Surge at: http://tiy-niclaswillems-etsy_search.surge.sh
